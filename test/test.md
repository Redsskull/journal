# My testing philosophy on this project

## So moment of truth

### I never wrote every line of testing myself until today

I did in bootcamp, maybe once per project. I asked AI to do it. This projects whole purpose is to code properly, like the old days(I debugged this thing with a ruler line by line, really) and so I set out to write the test like that too. 

I wrote them after I had quite the functionality, and I learned my favorite way to write tests is feature by feature, slowly as I go, which now will be done moving forward, but I won't write tests for every feature I already wrote, as it works(unless of course a bug is reported/discovered). I understand testing deeply now, and appreciate it much more. The current tests in serve to teach me that lesson, and I wanted to document it.
