# CLI Journal app made in Ruby

## A small journal app, my first Ruby creation. 

### What is it?

- Allows users to write entries with optional titles
- The program will always auto create a txt file with the date of the entry when it's closed.
- Entries can be edited or removed
- Style inspired by Alien isolations terminals.(Don't worry, no evil alien will chase it. Maybe I'll add that feature in the future)

## This project is very small, but I have plans for it

### What I'd like to add

- Probably should be able to choose the name of the file you're saving
- I want this to be useful for everyone, so some user interface, be it TUI or GUI(but it'll still look like Alien terminals added)
- Save in the file format in which you would like to
- Evil Alien showing up now and then(maybe allow the user to turn that off)
- I'm open to suggestions!
